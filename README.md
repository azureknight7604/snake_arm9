## How to setup
Download the savefile located in the /save directory.
> [!NOTE]
> Make sure that you download the correct savefile for your game's region. Also, you'll notices that at the end of the filename, that there are melon_PC and melon_android. 'melon_PC' is for the desktop version of melonDS emulator (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and 'melon_android' is for the android port of melonDS emualtor.

> [!WARNING]
> If you have an existing savefile, be sure to backup that first by either renaming it or make a copy of it. This is so that you can go back to your original savefile after you're done messing around with the modified savefile.
Place your savefile in the same directory as your Nintendo DS ROMs (most likley, depending on the setup/emulator). Next, rename your downloaded savefile the same as your Nintendo DS ROM filename.

Run melonDS emulator and select the game with the modified savefile.
At the "titlescreen" where you see New game and Continue, select Continue.
And if it works, you should see this screen:
